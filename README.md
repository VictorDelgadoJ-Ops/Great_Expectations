I chose Front-end developer as the job I was interested in because these jobs are a great way to get into the tech industry if you want to start your career as a coder. A Front-end developer is in charge of the visual UI/UX of an application/ software. This can include the interface, design, all buttons, and all effects on an application that people interact with. This job is seen as easier than a Back-end developer due to the fact that you are only scripting the interface of an application, but what this job requires more of than the back-end developer role is creativity, since you design the face of an application, not the programming that most people do not interact with. This tole combined with back-end development is what leads to a full-stack developer, which can accomplish both tasks.
